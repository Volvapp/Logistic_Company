# Logistics Company Web Application

## Overview
The **Logistics Company** web application is designed to manage the operations of a logistics company. The primary activities include receiving and delivering shipments. The company has offices in various locations and employs two types of staff: couriers (who handle the delivery of shipments) and office staff (who assist customers at the company's offices). Customers can send and/or receive shipments from the company's offices or another address. Shipments have a sender, recipient, delivery address, and weight. The delivery cost is determined by the weight of the shipment and whether it is delivered to an office or a specific address. Office deliveries are cheaper than address deliveries.
